			Options:	    -x range   --- show block(s) as hexadecimal data
				            -a range   --- show block(s) as ascii/hexadecimal data
				            -s range   --- show block(s) as superblock data

		5 - allocInode:
			Description:	Allocate a free inode. An inode is retrieved from the list of free inodes, marked in use, associated to the
							legal file type passed as a parameter and is generally initialized. 
							It is possible to allocate several inodes at the same time
			Arguments:		[number of inodes to allocate] [type of inode to be allocated]
			Example:		allocInode 20 1		-> allocate 20 inodes of type REGULAR FILE
							allocInode 1 3		-> allocate 1 inode of type SYMLINK

		6 - freeInode:
			Description:	Free the referenced inode. The inode is inserted into the list of free inodes.
							It is possibe to free several inodes at the same time
			Arguments:		[list of inodes to be freed]
			Example:		freeInode 3 4 5 6 9 2	-> inodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 will be freed

		7 - allocCluster:
			Description:	Allocate a free cluster. A cluster is retrieved from the list of free clusters.
							It is possible to allocate several cluster at the same time.
			Arguments:		[number of clusters to allocate]
			Example:		allocCluster 30			-> allocates 30 clusters

		8 - freeCluster:
			Description:	Free the referenced cluster. The cluster is inserted into the list of free clusters.
							It is possibe to free several clusters at the same time
			Arguments:		[list of clusters to be freed]
			Example:		freeCluster 3 4 5 6 9 2	-> clusters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 will be freed

		9 - replenish:
			Description:	Replenish the head cache. If the head cache is empty, it is filled with references retrieved from the references 
							head cluster or from the tail cache.
			Arguments:		-- no arguments

		10 - deplete:
			Description:	Deplete the tail cache. The references in the tail cache are transferred to the head cache or to the reference 
							tail cluster.
			Arguments:		-- no arguments

		11 - allocFilecluster:
			Description:	Associate a cluster to a given file cluster position.
							The test associates all the file cluster index to specified value
			Arguments:		[inode number] [File cluster index]
			Example:		allocFilecluster 1 350	-> for inode 1 allocates the first 350 file cluster indexes (runs the function 350 times)
		
		12 - freeFilecluster
			Description:	Free all file clusters from the given position on.
			Arguments:		[inode number] [File cluster index]
			Example:		freeFilecluster 1 200	-> for inode 1 all clusters from file cluster index 200 on

		13 - addDirentry:
			Description:	Add a new entry to the parent directory. A direntry is added connecting the parent inode to the child inode. The 
							refcount of the child inode is not incremented by this function.
							It is possible to add several Direntries at the same time.
							There is no need to allocate inodes before. The name of the direntries will be A followed by the chid inode 
							number
			Arguments:		[parent inode number][number of direntries to be added + 1]
			Example:		addDirentry 1 16	-> at inode 1 add 15 direntries of type directory (A2, ... ,A16)

		14 - delDirentry:
			Description:	Remove an entry from a parent directory. A direntry associated from the given directory is deleted. The refcount
							of the child inode is not decremented by this function.
							It is possible to delete several Direntries at the same time.
			Arguments:		[parent inode number][number of direntries to be deleted + 1]
			Example:		delDirentry 1 16	-> at inode 1 delete 15 direntries (A2, ... , A16)
